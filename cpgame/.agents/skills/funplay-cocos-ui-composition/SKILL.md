# Funplay Cocos UI Composition

## Instructions

## UI Workflow

1. Inspect the active scene, Canvas, design resolution, target viewports, `UITransform`, `Widget`, `Layout`, existing `SafeArea` policy, prefab ownership and serialized references.
2. Preserve the user's design requirements and established project baseline. A full-page reference may define a new screen's baseline; clarify cropped or conflicting references instead of imposing a fixed resolution.
3. Preserve existing roots, node/component identities, event bindings, animation targets and nested prefabs. Change only what the request requires; do not rebuild the entire prefab unless explicitly requested.
4. Choose one owner for each position/size property. Avoid conflicting Widget, Layout, animation and manual writes. Use supported Cocos scene/prefab/AssetDB workflows for authored assets.
5. Read back exact dimensions, anchors, constraints, SpriteFrame/font references and event bindings. Save/reopen when persistence matters; use preview input and screenshots for visual or interaction claims.

## Design Fidelity

- Preserve authored spacing and the project's adaptation. Do not proactively add SafeArea containers, adaptation scripts or extra insets. New adaptation requires an explicit request or a demonstrated overlap confirmed with the user.
- Keep complete UI pages in saved prefabs when that fits the project; runtime hierarchy creation is not a substitute for requested authored UI.
- A tool response, hierarchy, edit-scene performance counter and screenshot prove different things. Report unverified runtime, device, glyph or business behavior explicitly.

## Read Only the Relevant References

- For resolution, orientation, SafeArea, Widget/Layout, scrolling or masks: [layout and adaptation](references/layout-and-adaptation.md).
- For SpriteFrames, nine-slice, atlas or importer edits: [sprites and importers](references/sprites-and-importers.md).
- For fonts, text overflow, glyph coverage or requested localization: [text and localization](references/text-and-localization.md).
- For event bindings, real input, animation, screenshots or performance evidence: [input and validation](references/input-and-validation.md).

These references are conditional; do not load every file for a focused edit.
